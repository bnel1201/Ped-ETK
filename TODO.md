# TODOs

- [ ] Add multiple dose levels to LCD study (RZ from 10/5 meeting)
  - [ ] consider splitting this into multiple nodes to speed up
- [ ] Add HU accuracy using sensitometry module from CTP404 to get multiple HU levels
  - [ ]  requires that MTF results be performed with noise (discuss with Rongping) 
- [ ] Check that I'm using the correct model and dose level results for the adult reference data (seems to high)
