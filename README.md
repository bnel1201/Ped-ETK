## Introduction

## Tasks

- [ ] Make the adult size 1.) water phantom 2.) LCD phantom 3.) Contrast phantom
- [ ] Simulate low dose scans with the in-house simulations (Polychromatic on [BHC on + off] and Monochrome)
- [ ] Apply pretrained models from Prabhat on images from Step 2.
- [ ] Run evaluation scripts to the results of 2. to reproduce baseline
- [ ] Remake phantoms from step 1. In pediatric sizes using known reference sizes determined previously, include Newborn and 1 yr/old (going for most extreme size differences first to see most pronounced effect.)
- [ ] Repeat steps 2-4 with these pediatric phantoms
- [ ] Summarize the results and present
